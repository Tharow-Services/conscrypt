It\u0027s so because that way we don\u0027t need to go through another privacy review for AttributionNodes (which I was told we wouldn\u0027t need during office hours but oh well), and because that way we can have the info we need while maintaining the same experiment. Also I am writing the fields in the same order as the atom now that uid is last.",
