It will never return the number of plaintext bytes written (wpend_ret) until the entirely of wbuf is flushed, at which point it sets wbuf.left to 0.\n\nhttps://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p\u003dopenssl.git;a\u003dblob;f\u003dssl/s3_pkt.c;h\u003d25cf929a55d6decf3d815f28ab5e3ffd8d089b11;hb\u003drefs/heads/OpenSSL_1_0_1-stable#l910\n\n(If it behaved otherwise, the blocking mode of SSL_write would never work. Blocking code is not supposed to have to retry.)",
