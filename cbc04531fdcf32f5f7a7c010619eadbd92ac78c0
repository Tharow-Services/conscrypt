      "message": "For `m update-api` purpose, it\u0027s sufficient if the class has @hide. I think `m droid` succeeds without asking me to update the API .txt file.\n\nHowever, if you annotate a class @SystemApi(MODULE_LIBRARIES), that class needs @hide for every method. But apparently, conscrypt is still using @CorePlatformApi annotation, so I think @hide at the class-level should be sufficient.\n\nActually, if you need @hide at the method level, it\u0027s pretty easy to add it into the tool as well.",
