I had to add the conscrypt-for-host to the module_exports in a separate change to the one that changes how the conscrypt library is exported otherwise it breaks the master-art-host builds which use conscrypt prebuilts. After this has been submitted and prebuilts have been build then will need to update the conscrypt prebuilts and then submit the follow up CL.",

      "message": "The master-art(-host) branches use conscrypt prebuilts generated by the conscrypt sdk/module_exports. At the moment the prebuilts contains implementation jars for \"conscrypt\". The art \"conscrypt-host\" target depends on \"conscrypt\".\n\nIf I uploaded the topic which includes the change to switch \"conscrypt-host\" to depend on \"conscrypt-for-host\" then the master-art.. branches will fail because the prebuilts they use do not contain \"conscrypt-for-host\". If I didn\u0027t include the art change in the topic then the source builds would fail. Catch-22.\n\nSo, I have to split the work up as follows:\n1. Add conscrypt-for-host to the sdk/module_exports and wait for prebuilt snapshot to be generated by continuous build.\n2. Update the prebuilts in prebuilts/runtime/mainline/conscrypt/ to include a prebuilt for \"conscrypt-for-host\".\n3. Switch everything over to use \"conscrypt-for-host\", which is now in both source and prebuilts.\n4. Move \"conscrypt\" from the \"java_libs\" property to \"java_boot_libs\" property and wait for prebuilt snapshot to be generated by continuous build.\n5. Update the prebuilts in prebuilts/runtime/mainline/conscrypt/.",
