      "message": "Isn\u0027t this only the case because it\u0027s explicitly mentioned in native_shared_libs in the apex module?\n\nI think \"required\" is the proper solution here, rather than having to list the libs explicitly in native_shared_libs, but it doesn\u0027t work: Partly because of b/124476339 that I\u0027ve been adding TODO\u0027s about, and partly because of the reason you mention here (which I didn\u0027t know about).\n\nSo I\u0027m not objecting to doing this, just the wanted to adjust the motivation. I suggest you add a TODO in apex/Android.sp like this one: http://cs/aosp-master/art/build/apex/Android.bp?l\u003d34-35\u0026rcl\u003d4080b8febed8b82957274882a96b2a7d8625c32e",
