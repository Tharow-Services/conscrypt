How about I just use the first patchset in which this is named release since that\u0027s what it is doing.\n\nI basically can\u0027t close the underlying stream since that would break the CertificateFactory, et al., that use this.",

      "message": "I\u0027m confused about the design of this class. It looks like none of its read/gets methods actually use the native BIO stuff.  Is this class meant to provide a way for native code to read from an InputStream using the \"gets\" method declared in this class? If so, then why does this class have to manage the lifetime of the \"ctx\" that it doesn\u0027t use? To avoid derailing this CL whose main goal is to switch from BIO_free to BIO_free_all, I\u0027m fine with PS#1.",

      "message": "Yes, it\u0027s a way for native code to call up to Java to read a small number of bytes. Typically we can\u0027t be guaranteed to be able to rewind streams, so we can\u0027t just blast a bunch of bytes into a buffer and give it to native code. The native code won\u0027t really tell us what it\u0027s read. So I made this class to be sure we only read what we need to make sure we keep the contract with CertificateFactory.",
