      "message": "Sorry, in retrospect my -1 was probably a bit heavy-handed. Also, I realize now that the sentence here is technically correct, because anything \u003e Q, i.e. anything \u003e 29 would have broken. What I didn\u0027t want to do was to state that SDK 30 \u003d\u003d R, but strictly speaking this commit message didn\u0027t do that.\n\nUndoing my -1. That said, the R constant that the code is referring to doesn\u0027t exist yet, so I guess that needs to happen first.",
