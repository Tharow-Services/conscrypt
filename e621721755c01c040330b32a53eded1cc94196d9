      "message": "Er, to clarify: with or without this change, SSL_renegotiate in BoringSSL always failed. BoringSSL can\u0027t initiate renego, only accept it as a client.\n\nWhich means this line isn\u0027t reachable in BoringSSL ports, so it doesn\u0027t actually matter that SSL_set_state is, strictly speaking, a no-op in BoringSSL. (Reaching into the SSL* and messing with its state machine is kind of insane. OpenSSL\u0027s renego API is terrible.)\n\nGiven that, I\u0027m not sure what the test is doing when compiled against BoringSSL since it apparently doesn\u0027t notice. But this change shouldn\u0027t make things worse.",
