      "message": "This is pretty much the second stage.  For the initial change I think we should just remove TLS v1.0 and v1.1 from the list of default protocols, e.g. `NativeCrypto.TLSV13_PROTOCOLS`, which are the lists used to populate `SSLContext` instances.  So we also need to keep the tests, but they may need adapting, e.g. to create an `SSLContext` which enables TLSv1.x if they need multiple protocols enabled.\n\nBonus points for putting it behind a flag so we can control the rollout.  We haven\u0027t wired up Mainline flags to Conscrypt before so maybe just adda couple of method to Platform.java (`isTlsV1Deprecated()` etc) and we can figure out the flag part in a separate CL.",
