To be picky, I think you\u0027re still assuming quite a lot of the reader.\n\nSuggestion:\n\nPrevents libjavacrypto being pulled into /system/lib unnecessarily for target builds. libjavacrypto should not be in /system for target because it is only used by the conscrypt apex which has its own copy.\n\nPrevious to this change, there was a required: on the build target which caused the build system to make the libjavacrypto.so available at runtime via /system/lib. Now, there is only an explicit dependency for the host variant. The apex dependency onto libjavacrypto.so is already present in the apex definition found in conscrypt/apex.",
