Conscrypt - A Java Security Provider
========================================

Conscrypt is a fast, native alternative to the default security provider of the JDK based on [BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/). It was originally developed for Android, but has since been repurposed for any Java platform.

The core SSL engine has borrowed liberally from the [Netty](http://netty.io/) project and their work on [netty-tcnative](http://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html), giving `Conscrypt` similar performance. You can think of Conscrypt as `netty-tcnative` + full Java security provider.

Download
-------------

#### Download JARs
You can download [the JARs](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.conscrypt%22%20AND%20v%3A%221.0.1%22) directly from the Maven repositories.
 
#### OpenJDK (i.e. non-Android)

##### Maven
Use the [os-maven-plugin](https://github.com/trustin/os-maven-plugin) to add the dependency:

```
<build>
  <extensions>
    <extension>
      <groupId>kr.motd.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>os-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.4.1.Final</version>
    </extension>
  </extensions>
</build>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.conscrypt</groupId>
  <artifactId>conscrypt-openjdk</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <classifier>${os.detected.classifier}</classifier>
</dependency>
```

##### Gradle
Use the [osdetector-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/google/osdetector-gradle-plugin) (which is a wrapper around the os-maven-plugin) to add the dependency:

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.google.gradle:osdetector-gradle-plugin:1.4.0'
  }
}

// Use the osdetector-gradle-plugin
apply plugin: "com.google.osdetector"

dependencies {
  compile 'org.conscrypt:conscrypt-jdk:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:' + osdetector.classifier
}
```

Artifacts are available for the following platforms:

Classifier | Description
---------------- | -----------
windows-x86_64 | Windows distribution
osx-x86_64 | Mac distribution
linux-x86_64 | Used for Linux

How to Build
------------

If you are making changes to Conscrypt, see the [building
instructions](BUILDING.md).

Source Overview
----------------------------

Here's a quick readers' guide to the code to help folks get started. At a high
level there are three distinct modules: __Common__, __Android__ &
__OpenJDK__.

### Common

This contains the bulk of the code. It contains stub classes for platform-specific functions, which
are stripped out of the final JAR.

It also contains all of the native code, but does not build any native artifacts. Instead, the
platform-specific modules will include this source in their builds.

### Android

This module provides the `Platform` class for Android and also adds compatibility classes for
supporting various versions of Android. This generates an `apk` library artifact.

### OpenJDK

This modules provides the `Platform` class for non-Android (OpenJDK-based) systems. It also provides
a native library loader supports bundling the shared library with the JAR.
