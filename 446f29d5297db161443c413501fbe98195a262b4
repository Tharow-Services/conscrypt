So we might need to allocate it rather than just using local variables... In which case they\u0027ll probably need to be added to app_data.h to track them until the socket is closed.  \n\nIf you\u0027ve worked through that, maybe add a few comments to clarify lifetimes and ownership because currently it\u0027s not clear to me which arrays need to outlive this function and where stuff gets freed.",
