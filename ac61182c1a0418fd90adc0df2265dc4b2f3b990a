Not only did this get missed when that test was split into client and server parts but it looks like the upstream fix didn\u0027t make it back into AOSP correctly.\n\nRather than fix this just in android-11-tests-dev and get future merge conflicts, I\u0027ll fix it upstream and send you a cherrypick from AOSP master.",
