But unless I\u0027m missing something, I can\u0027t see any difference in the way these new private tests are configured.\n\nSo if there\u0027s a piece of config I have missed, let\u0027s add it to CtsLibcoreTestCases (and also add the openjdk/ tests!)",

      "message": "Sorry, I should have shared a bit more of the context.\n\nSo the key difference with this new test module is that it is *not* for CTS.\n\nYou can see it as a low-level, unittest suite for conscrypt. It has access to the private api, and can exercise more edge cases.\n\nIt is complementary to CTS (and we should eventually have a more end-to-end test for CT in CTS), but as you mentioned, CTS should rely on the public API (the API we don\u0027t expect to change).\n\nThe reason that it is not in CTS, is because it\u0027s not testing the *compatibility* of a device for the platform, but simply testing the platform code itself.\n\nIt can still be executed in presubmit (only on ToT, as to avoid any API misalignment between the library and the tests).\n\nI will also remove the @NonCts annotation that I added recently, as it doesn\u0027t make sense for these private tests.",
