      "message": "Ryan\u0027s comment about loading libraries in the wrong namespace applies here too. The default namespace here is effectively \"conscrypt\", which means it is different from the one that\u0027s default in the ART APEX (aka \"runtime\").\n\nThe right way here is to introduce the \"runtime\" namespace in this file too. However, I don\u0027t *think* it matters in practice in this case, and depending on how we go on http://b/139916951 the right fix might look differently. So for now I think a TODO comment is enough so it doesn\u0027t fall through the cracks; I\u0027ll send out a CL with that.",
